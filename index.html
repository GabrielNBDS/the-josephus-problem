      <h2>
        In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus problem (or Josephus
        permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out
        game.
      </h2>
      <p>
        People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins
        at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a
        specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, 
        the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the 
        remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same 
        direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person 
        remains, and is freed.
